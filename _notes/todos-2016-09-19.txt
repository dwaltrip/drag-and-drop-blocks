# NOTES #
---------

For creating new widgets by dragging from the toolbox:

Once we 'dragenter' the workspace, the widget becomes a real widget.

While still dragging within the toolbox, it's a toolbox widget.

Any widget that is dropped in the toolbox is removed.

Any widget that is dropped in the workspace is a workspace widget.

If we drag from the toolbox straight to the trashcan, it should be removed.
